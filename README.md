# VulnCases

I used to write vulnerable code snippets in order to understand how they work, how to reverse engineer, and how to exploit them. However, if you just want to learn how to spot vulnerabilities, an easy and fun way nowadays is practice with ChatGPT by setting up your test this way:

```
I want to practice some C/C++ vulnerabilities that are based on real world problems, or mimic them.  Give me a code snippet with one of these vulnerability problems:

* Out-of-bound READ
* Out-of-bound WRITE
* Any buffer overflows
* Use after free
* Memroy leak
* Off by one problems
* Integer overflow
* Integer underflow
* Type confusion

Make the problem real and kind of challenging for me. Make me explain what the problem is. Each test should:

* Should not provide any hint
* Leave no comments in code
* Don't start with main(), but you can tell me which arguments are user-controlled.
* Have a rating of the difficulty

If I get the answer wrong, don't give me the answer. Just tell me it is wrong, and remind me to try again. However:

* If I ask for hint, you can give me a hint.
* If I admit I don't know, you can give me the answer.
```
